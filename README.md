Python Work--Robotic Fight Partner

This Python off line script is to randomly select an X,Y axes as target for the robotic fighing partner's weapons(fists,elbows,knees,feet).
An object is created by passing two required attributes, opponent attack style and the opening position:  boxer, streetfigher, karate, etc., frontal, left forward, right forward., etc.  Then an arm_strike method to create the capabilities with a random arm strike which then would be sent to the robot arm which then would trigger the proper movement for one to practice against.

Includes Class counter to total number attacker instances.
