Python Work--Virtual Attacker Robot
This Python script is to randomly select an X,Y axes as target for the robotic fighing partner's weapons(fists,elbows,knees,feet).
Just pick an attacker style to create it's class, then pass into the Attacker Class the style: boxer, streetfigher, karate, etc.
with an opening like frontal, left forward, right forward., etc.  Add a arm_strike method to create the random strikes which then would be sent to the robot which then would trigger the proper movement to practice against.

Includes Class counter to total number of attack instances.
